- title: How to innovate smarter and build world-changing products 
  copy: Methodologies such as Lean and Agile have taught us to harness the power of iteration to innovate faster -- we've learned how to drive faster, but our ability to set the destination hasn't kept pace. When we iterate in the absence of a vision and strategy, our products and companies become bloated, fragmented, and driven by irrelevant metrics. They catch “product diseases” which are often fatal to innovation.  
  copyPart2: This talk introduces you to a radical new approach to build successful companies and deliver world-changing innovation repeatably. We’ll challenge conventional wisdom about what makes a good vision and talk about where the current mantras for product development fall short. You’ll walk away with practical tools to develop a vision for the change you want to bring about in the world and translate that systematically into reality.

- title: Bringing your vision into your everyday work
  copy: Although you’re contributing to the company’s vision, your everyday activities can often feel purely tactical with a focus on execution and delivering a set of features. When activities become disconnected from the vision and strategy, products often catch diseases. This can also affect morale - a product manager may feel like a backlog administrator, and a software developer may feel like a programmer. 
  copyPart2: Learn how to align teams by crafting a clear vision and use this vision in everyday decision-making. You’ll gain tools to communicate with stakeholders to balance achieving the vision while dealing with the reality of business needs. You’ll be able to spread your influence and intuition across your organization so decisions align with your goals even when you're not around. You’ll walk away with practical techniques to translate vision into action as you build successful, world-changing products.

- title: Radical Product Thinking Your Culture
  copy: Culture is a pervasive problem and 57% of employees in tech report feeling burnt out. A good culture is not something that happens accidentally and must be carefully engineered. The problem, however, is that culture feels like an amorphous concept and the idea of “culture change” is often met with eye-rolls.
  copyPart2: This session brings you a new perspective on culture and transforms the amorphous idea of culture into a set of actionable steps so you can make work feel more meaningful, and help high-performing teams thrive. Just as you measure metrics for your product or company, we’ll talk about how you can measure progress towards creating a culture that high-performing product teams need for innovation. You’ll be able to use these practical techniques to create a more close-knit culture across your team.

- title: Radically Rethinking OKRs
  copy: Popularized by Google’s financial success, OKRs have been widely adopted by companies to communicate goals and measure progress. We’ve come to believe that OKRs and goal-setting is the key to scaling our products and companies.
  copyPart2: In reality, most companies implementing OKRs see a series of unfortunate side effects, and several studies have confirmed how goal-setting can be detrimental to innovation. OKRs often cause the product disease Hypermetricemia. In this interactive session, we’ll talk about the symptoms of Hypermetricemia and how you can get the same benefits of OKRs while avoiding the unintended consequences. We’ll discuss radical ideas that challenge conventional wisdom on goal setting. You’ll walk away with practical tools to align your teams on the impact you want to create and measure progress along the way.

- title: Embracing responsibility and the Hippocratic Oath of Product
  copy: While our innovation has often solved problems for people, the unintended consequences have also inflicted collateral damage to society. Just as unregulated industrial growth led to environmental pollution, unregulated growth in the digital era is creating digital pollution. Our products deeply affect people’s lives - we need to recognize the effects of digital pollution so we can take responsibility for our products.
  copyPart2: This talk starts with creating awareness of the types of digital pollution. We’ll talk about the Hippocratic Oath of Product and how we can embrace the responsibility that comes with the superpower of building world-changing products. You’ll gain practical tools to manage this responsibility against the reality of your short-term business needs. We’ll cover how each of us can take a vision-driven approach to innovation and avoid collateral damage to society.

- title: Transforming from a project to a product mindset
  copy: A product-led transformation requires alignment across the organization to bring others with you on the journey. It requires a shared understanding of the change you’re working to bring about and how transformation looks its end state. It also requires people to adopt new ways of working and a new product-led mindset.
  copyPart2: This talk uses a case study to show how you can take a systematic approach to transformation and make your product-led transformation a smoother ride. It will help you spread your influence and scale your thinking across the organization so that transformation isn’t just an idea being pushed from the top. This session will help you gain or sustain momentum for a product-led transformation. It will give your team practical techniques to apply product thinking and demonstrate quick and meaningful wins on the road to transformation.
